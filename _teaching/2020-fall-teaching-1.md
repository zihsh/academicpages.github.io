Description
======
《Digital Signal Processing》 is one of the compulsory courses for undergraduates in electronic information specialty. The fundamental concepts, theories, and basic approaches in digital signal processing are the main contents of this course, including time-domain and frequency-domain analysis of discrete-time signal and system, discrete Fourier transform and its fast algorithms, and the design of digital filters. The teaching outcomes are to make the students understand the basic concepts of digital signal processing, master the fundamental theories and the design of digital filters, and learn some new approaches and technologies that used for digital signal processing. These are benefit to the study of the follow-up professional courses and the research on digital signal processing algorithm. In this course, we use the theory teaching as the main tool, and in particular, we use examples and math analysis to make the student deeply understand the main theories and approaches of digital signal processing. Also, in this course, homework and programming will be arranged for students.

Syllabus
======
1.	Understand the principles, developments, applications and characteristics of digital signal processing; Master the time-domain and frequency- domain methods for analyzing discrete time signals and systems. (1-1，2-3)
2.	Understand the basic principles, properties and applications of discrete Fourier transform. (2-1)
3.	Master the basic principle of fast discrete Fourier transform (FDFT) with the ability of realizing FDFT by programming and analyzing its advantages. (5-2)
4.	Master the structure and the basic design method of digital filters; Earn the ability of design of an effective digital filter with respect to the demands of an actual problem. (3-1)
